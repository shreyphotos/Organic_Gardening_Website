        <h3>The soaring cost of many basic food items, coupled with a general downturn in the economy, is enough to make the idea of growing your own food look appealing. For some, it can become a real necessity. For others, homegrown vegetables simply taste better.</h3>

        <h3>At the same time, there are simple lessons to be learned before you can become a successful gardener. They are not complicated, for the most part, and can be mastered with a little care and attention. These lessons are the focus of this series.</h3>

        <h3>For many years there has been considerable discussion, even among those claiming to be organic gardeners, as to exactly what constitutes organic gardening. In general, organic gardening differs from traditional gardening in two important ways: use of agricultural chemicals and use of artificial or processed fertilizers.</h3>

        <h3>Organic gardening rejects the use of all artificial agricultural chemicals, including pesticides used to control insects, diseases and weeds. Organic gardeners differ concerning which, if any, naturally derived pesticides are permissible and when and how they may be used.</h3>

        <h3>Most organic gardeners consider soils to be a living system and reject artificial chemical fertilizers as harmful to the soil and the environment. Organic gardeners emphasize building soil organic matter and then rely on natural sources of supplemental nutrients. Many people garden organically because of concern over pesticide residues on food.</h3>
        <h3>Organic gardeners are usually willing to tolerate some damage that traditional agriculture perceives as reducing quality to the product. Organic gardeners generally feel occasional insect or disease injury or reduced color and shelf stability is worth the environmental benefits of growing vegetables organically.</h3>

        <h3>There is little doubt that organic gardening improves soils because of the emphasis on increasing soil organic matter. Increased soil organic matter improves soil tilth and structure, improves water retention and evens out nutrient release.</h3>

        <h3>Insect and disease control can be an issue. Some pest problems are easily controlled by organic alternatives. Others are controlled only with difficulty or have no reliable organic controls. Some crops must be avoided by organic gardeners or these gardeners must be willing to risk significant losses from pests.</h3>

        <h3>Careful timing of plantings is an excellent way to reduce the severity of some problems. Cutworms for example, tend to be more severe early in the spring, but decline as temperatures increase and rainfall decreases.</h3>

        <h3>Several types of barriers can be used to prevent cutworms from reaching a plant or plants. Small paper or plastic cups with the bottoms removed, for example, can be pushed into the ground around young transplants to protect them from cutworms. Aluminum foil wrapped around young plants will serve the same purpose.</h3>

        <h3>Exploring what nature is doing to your garden each day is the best way to prevent small problems from turning into big problems.</h3>

            <h1>Why it’s so important to choose organic gardening?</h1>
        </center>
        <h3>There are countless reasons to choose organic gardening over conventional gardening. Here are a few of the most important reasons that gardeners choose to go organic:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Grow healthy food that is free of synthetic chemicals (and avoid chemical residue)</h3>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Support pollinators by providing safe sources of food and shelter for them.</h3>
            </li>

            <li>

                <h3>Learn about and emulate nature’s processes rather than upsetting the balance of the ecosystem.</h3>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Keep pesticides and fertilizers out of your home (brought in with air, dirt, flowers, or veggies).</h3>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Reduce pollution by eliminating pesticide and fertilizer transfer off your property.</h3>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Create habitat for local critters by growing native plants.</h3>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Support healthy soil biodiversity rather than contaminating the soil with chemicals.</h3>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Motivate photosynthesis and reduce the carbon dioxide in the environment.</h3>

        <h3>There are lots of questions that come up when deciding to create an organic garden instead of a conventional garden. How do you control pests without pesticides? How do you feed crops without fertilizer? With all of the different gardening products for sale, it can be hard to figure out what is safe for organic gardening and what isn’t.</h3>
        <h3>A good part of the success of an organic garden depends on observing and emulating nature. Plants are able to grow in nature without anyone fertilizing them, pruning them, or watering them. The system does all of this on its own, creating a vibrant ecosystem with no one tending to it. Having a successful organic garden depends on learning from and mimicking nature.</h3>

        <h3>Fortunately, the field of organic gardening is not new, and there are lots of great resources to create a healthy organic garden. Focusing on soil health, choosing organic methods of feeding plants, and managing pests in a holistic manner can all help create a thriving garden.</h3>
        <h3>Organic methods of growing food were originally created to preserve the biodiversity of agricultural soil. Organic gardening works with the natural life in soil rather than considering it a sterile medium in which to install plants. There are countless important micro-organisms that live in the upper soil horizons, which are encouraged and supported by organic gardening methods.
        </h3>
        <h3>Organic gardening uses methods such as crop rotation, nutrient replacement (green manure, compost), and no-till methods to support healthy soil. These methods do not disturb the soil matrix or the micro-organisms that call the soil home.</h3>

        <h3>When nutrient-rich materials are removed from the garden for humans to eat or to put into the compost, these nutrients must be replenished for future crops. Nutrients can be replenished by adding organic matter back into the garden.
        </h3>
        <h3>Feeding your plants organically is possible by using organic soil amendments rather than synthetically-produced chemicals. One of the best organic plant foods is homemade compost, made from composted shredded fall leaves and other kitchen and garden trimmings. Keep the organic matter your yard produces on-site, and compost it into yummy plant food for your garden! Compost can be applied directly to your garden as a mulch or even made into “compost tea” to provide a boost of nutrients.
        </h3>
        <h3>Other options for feeding your organic garden include cover cropping, growing nitrogen-accumulating plants, or purchasing organic plant food. Cover cropping, or green manure, involves planting a healthy cover crop during the off-season which is then tilled into the soil to add back nutrients.
        </h3>
        <h3>Purchasing organic plant food usually means looking for the OMRI-approved label. OMRI (the Organic Materials Review Institute) is an independent organization that reviews products to create a list of products that are approved for use in organic growing. Look for the OMRI-approved label on any plant food you purchase.</h3>
       <h3>Organic fertilizers are made from plant-derived resources, which might be fresh or dried plant material.

The nutritional content of organic fertilizers varies widely depending on the source material, with rapidly biodegradable compounds serving as suitable nutrient sources.

The organic carbon content of an organic fertilizer may be as critical, if not more so, than the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations.

Organic fertilizers, which promote secondary productivity and mineralize nutrients to raise primary productivity, produce increases in heterotrophic bacterial biomass.

Farmers, landscapers, and gardeners will find these fertilizers to be incredibly cost-effective.

Homeowners can utilize natural fertilizers to improve the performance of their plants. Organic fertilizers are simple to use and fully safe to utilize.

These natural products are easy to use and do not require the use of costly protective clothing or equipment.

Its use does not demand a great level of competence, and it can be used by inexperienced farmers as well.

These fertilizers come in a variety of forms and are substantially less expensive than expensive man-made fertilizers.</h3>
